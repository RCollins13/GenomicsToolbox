#Script to perform bidirectional gene list enrichment tests by permutation
#Bidirectional performs two tests:
# 1) Probability of enrichment of set A in set B versus random chance
# 2) Probability of enrichment of set B in set A versus random chance

Script to perform bidirectional permutation-based enrichment tests for two gene lists

Usage: bidirectionalEnrichment.sh [-n PERMUTATIONS] LIST1 LIST2 REF_LIST
===============
LIST1               First gene list (required)
LIST2               Second gene list (required)
REF_LIST            List of all genes eligible for permutation (required)
-n PERMUTATIONS     Number of random permutations (default: 10,000)
-h                  Print this message
===============
